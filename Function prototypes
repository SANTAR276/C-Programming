#include <stdio.h>

void hello(char[], int); // This is a function prototype
/*
    
    A function prototype is declared without a body, and comes before the main function
    Makes sure that all of the arguments are met for that function

    This is useful because
    1. A compiler might not check for parameter matching before running a code
    2. Missing arguments will result in random unwanted values to be inputted
    3. It is easy to check for errors if there are arguments missing
    4. It helps a lot with debugging
    5. Commonly used in header files
    6. It is easier to navigate a program with the main function at the top
